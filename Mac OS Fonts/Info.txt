To install the HUD navigate to 
username (home directory)/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom
and drag the HUD you want to install into that folder.

After you've installed the HUD you should then apply the Mac Fonts by copying them into your /hudname/resource/fonts folder.

Please drop me a message on GitHub if this is not working correctly.
