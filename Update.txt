WARNING: Initial commit, this version might have broken things and bugs everywhere!

////

This is another (I think it's the 4th) complete overhaul of the HUD. I started with porting "flv" to "fl", but there will be more versions in the future.

The font switch is for avoiding cut-offs at certain resolutions and might enable Mac support at a later point.

I took in most of the changes that I made to the "flv" version for Tip of the Hats and created a new spectator interface based on that.

I also went back to the old circle style for score counters and the team menu, I guess everything comes full circle again at some point (hehe, sorry).
I'm personally really happy with the new tournament ready up that came as a result of this.

Besides that I've changed some commonly requested stuff, such as adding the killstreak display on the winpanel, centering the freezecam and adding other sensible defaults.
