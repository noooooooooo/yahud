To install the HUD navigate to 
username (home directory)/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom
and drag the HUD you want to install into that folder.

After you've installed the HUD you should then apply the Mac Fonts by dragging the resource folder contained in this folder to the same location, overriding the fonts.

Please drop me a message on GitHub if this is not working correctly.
